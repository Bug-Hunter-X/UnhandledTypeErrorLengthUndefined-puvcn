# Unhandled TypeError in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error: attempting to access the `length` property of an undefined variable. The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.  The error arises when the function receives `undefined` as input, causing a `TypeError`. The solution adds a check for both `null` and `undefined` inputs.
